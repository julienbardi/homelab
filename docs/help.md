## 🧱 Prerequisites

- `make prereqs` — Install and verify core system prerequisites
- `make deps` — Install common build and runtime dependencies
- `make apt-update` — Force refresh apt cache (normally cached)

## 🔐 Security / access control

- `make harden-groups` — Verify group membership invariants (read-only)
- `make enforce-groups` — Enforce group membership (authorized admin only)
- `make check-groups` — Inspect group memberships

## 🧩 System tuning

- `make sysctl-preflight` — Validates system dependencies, source file existence. Run as a guard for all other sysctl targets.
- `make sysctl-inspect` — Read-only audit of current IPv6 identities.
  - IID Mapping: Displays the 64-bit Interface Identifier for every global and ULA prefix.
  - Live State: Filters out "tentative" or "deprecated" addresses to show exactly what the kernel is using for active traffic.
  - `make install-homelab-sysctl` — Reconciles the system-level forwarding rules with the repository source.
    - Functional Diffing: Uses a strip-diff engine to ignore local secrets and comments.
    - Hardware Aware: Only injects stable_secret for active interfaces (e.g., eth0, eth1).
    - Post-Apply Validation: Queries the kernel via sysctl -n to verify the state was actually accepted.
    - Idempotent Reporting: Summarizes changes (Config update / Secret injection / NOP).
  - `make rotate-ipv6-secrets` — Destructive/Identity Rotation.
  - Surgically removes existing IPv6 Stable Secrets and generates new 128-bit cryptographic identifiers.
  - Privacy: Rotates the RFC 7217 Interface Identifier (IID).
  - Side Effect: Triggers a 5-second countdown followed by a hard reboot to enforce kernel regeneration of IPv6 addresses.
  - ⚠️ Note: This will change your NAS's IPv6 addresses (GUA and ULA). Firewall rules on the router or external peers may need updating.
- `make net-tunnel-preflight` — Ensure NIC offload settings for UDP tunnels

## 🔥 NAS firewall — service exposure

## 🌐 Router DDNS

The router uses an event-driven DynDNS script compatible with Asuswrt-Merlin.
The DDNS layer is split into deployment and execution for clarity and safety.

Targets:

- `router-ddns-deploy`
  Deploys the DDNS runtime surface (`ddns-start` and secret material) to the router.
  This target is idempotent and performs no network calls.

- `router-ddns-run`
  Executes the DDNS update logic on the router. Safe to re-run; provider-level
  idempotence (`good` / `nochg`) is relied upon.

- `router-ddns`
  Convenience target that performs both deployment and execution.
  This is the default and recommended entry point.

Secrets are validated structurally via `ddns-secret-ensure` before deployment.
No cron jobs are installed; execution is event-driven by Asuswrt-Merlin.

## 🔐 WireGuard — lifecycle

No WireGuard configuration reaches runtime unless both intent and rendered artifacts validate successfully.

- `make wg-install-scripts` — Install WireGuard operational scripts
- `make wg` — Compile, deploy, apply, and verify WireGuard state
- `make wg-compile` — Compile intent and keys
- `make wg-apply` — Apply rendered configuration to runtime
- `make wg-check` — Validate compiled WireGuard intent (`plan.tsv`)
- `make wg-render` — Render configs **and validate rendered artifacts**
- ⚠️ `make wg-rebuild-all` — Full destructive rebuild

`wg-render` includes a mandatory post‑render validation step.
Rendered client and server configs are checked against `plan.tsv`
and the build fails if any artifact deviates from intent.

Rendered WireGuard configurations are treated as authoritative artifacts.
They are validated against `plan.tsv` before deployment.
Any mismatch causes the build to fail and prevents runtime changes.

## 🔐 WireGuard — client lifecycle

- `make wg-rotate-client base=<base> iface=<iface>` — Rotate client key (revokes old key)
- `make wg-remove-client base=<base> iface=<iface>` — Permanently remove client

Note: These targets manage WireGuard intent and runtime state.
Router forwarding and authorization are handled by the
**Router WireGuard — control plane (layered)** targets.

## 🔍 WireGuard — inspection (read-only)

- `make wg-status` — Interface and peer summary
- `make wg-runtime` — Kernel peer state
- `make wg-dashboard` — Client ↔ interface mapping
- `make wg-clients` — Client inventory
- `make wg-intent` — Addressing and endpoint intent
- `make wg-check-rendered` — Validate rendered WireGuard configs against plan intent

## 🔐 Router WireGuard — control plane (layered)

The router WireGuard control plane is explicitly layered and fail‑closed:

- **Transport layer** — packet reachability only (DNAT / FORWARD)
- **Policy layer** — per‑client authorization (LAN / WAN access)
- **Composition layer** — deterministic ordering and auditing

Firewall invariants and WireGuard policy are intentionally decoupled.

### Transport & policy

- `make router-wg-transport`
  Deploy and apply WireGuard transport rules on the router.
  This enables packet flow but does **not** grant access.

- `make router-wg-policy`
  Apply WireGuard authorization policy from `plan.tsv`.
  This layer is **fail‑closed**: if the plan is missing or invalid,
  WireGuard forwarding is blocked.

### Canonical entrypoint

Typical workflow:

```sh
make router-wg-converge
make router-wg-audit
```

This applies transport and policy deterministically and verifies that no drift occurred.
This does three things:

- Makes the commands memorable
- Prevents people from running transport/policy separately
- Encodes your operational intent in documentation

- `make router-wg-converge`
  Apply WireGuard transport **then** policy in the correct order.
  This is the **only recommended entrypoint** for router WireGuard changes.

### Auditing & diagnostics (read‑only)

- `make router-wg-audit`
  Verify WireGuard policy chains, FORWARD hooks, and interface state.
  Detects drift after reboot or firmware updates.

- `make router-wg-reset`
  Flush WireGuard policy chains only (transport untouched).
  Intended for debugging and recovery.

## 📦 Infrastructure

- `make install-all`
- `make uninstall-all`

### Router: Access & diagnostics

- `make router-ssh-check` — Verify non‑interactive SSH access to router
- `make router-health` — Read‑only router health check
- `make router-health-strict` — Enforce strict security invariants

### Router: Bootstrap & firewall

`router-bootstrap` establishes a safe, minimal control plane on the router
(SSH access, helper scripts, DDNS, base firewall hooks) but does not expose services.

- `make router-bootstrap` — Install helpers and converge base services
- `make router-firewall` — Assert Skynet firewall enforcement
- `make router-firewall-install` — Deploy firewall hook script
- `make router-firewall-started` — Assert base firewall is running
- `make router-firewall-hardened` — Assert full firewall hardening
- `make router-firewall-audit` — Dump firewall rules and WireGuard state

### Router: Certificates (internal CA)

- `make certs-create` — Create internal CA (idempotent)
- `make certs-deploy` — Deploy certificates to router
- `make certs-ensure` — Ensure CA exists and is deployed
- `make certs-status` — Show deployed certificate status
- `make certs-expiry` — Show CA expiry date
- `make certs-rotate-dangerous` — Rotate CA (DESTRUCTIVE)
- `make router-certs-deploy` — Deploy router certificates
- `make router-certs-validate` — Validate router certificates
- `make router-certs-validate-caddy` — Validate Caddy certificates

### Router: Caddy (router edge)

- `make router-caddy-install` — Install Caddy binary on router
- `make router-caddy-config` — Push and validate Caddy configuration
- `make router-caddy` — Full Caddy deployment
- `make router-caddy-status` — Show Caddy process status
- `make router-caddy-start` — Start Caddy
- `make router-caddy-stop` — Stop Caddy

### Router: WireGuard (control plane)

These targets manage WireGuard intent compilation, rendered‑artifact validation,
and runtime state on the router. They do not modify firewall or forwarding policy.

- `make router-wg-deploy` — Deploy WireGuard compiler scripts to router
- `make router-wg-check` — Compile and validate WireGuard intent
- `make router-wg-dump` — Compile with WG_DUMP=1 for inspection
- `make router-wg-preflight` — Validate router WireGuard environment

Firewall transport and authorization are handled separately
by the router WireGuard control‑plane targets.

### Router orchestration (aggregates)

- `make router-all` — Converge router baseline (DDNS, dnsmasq cache, firewall started)
- `make router-all-full` — router-all + full Caddy converge (service exposure)

### 🧰 Local Developer Tools

- `make lint` — Lint Makefiles with checkmake
- `make lint-fast` — Fast linting (subset of checks)
- `make lint-all` — Full lint suite across repo
- `make lint-scripts` — Lint shell scripts
- `make lint-scripts-partial` — Lint only changed scripts
- `make lint-semantic` — Validate semantic commit messages
- `make lint-semantic-strict` — Strict semantic commit validation
- `make tools` — Install local developer tooling
- `make spellcheck` — Interactive spellcheck of Markdown files
- `make spellcheck-comments` — Spellcheck Makefile comments
- `make distclean` — Remove local tools and staged scripts
- `make clean` — Remove local build artifacts
- `make clean-soft` — Remove temporary files without touching tools

## 💻 Code‑server

The local VS Code server is managed declaratively.

- `make code-server-install`
  Installs or upgrades code‑server using the upstream installer.
  Always installs the latest stable release (e.g. v4.112.0).
  Idempotent: safe to re‑run.

- `make code-server-enable`
  Enables the systemd user service and ensures it starts on boot.

- `make code-server-ensure-running`
  Ensures code‑server is running with the correct configuration and systemd override.
  Restarts automatically if configuration changed.

### Notes

- The systemd override forces code‑server to run with the managed config at
  `~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`.
- The install target tracks upstream automatically.
- If deterministic version pinning is required, replace the installer script with a pinned release artifact.

## 📝 Notes

- Router targets are split into deploy vs execute where side effects exist.
  Aggregate targets compose these explicitly.
- All state is intent-driven; validation failures never modify deployed state.
- Scripts are never executed from the repository.
- Destructive targets are explicit and never run implicitly.
- Runtime reconciliation is gated; use `FORCE=1` only after reviewing drift.
- Router WireGuard forwarding is explicitly layered:
  transport enables reachability, policy grants access.
  Missing or invalid policy fails closed.
- `make router-verify` asserts non‑negotiable router security invariants
  and must pass after firmware updates or reboots.
