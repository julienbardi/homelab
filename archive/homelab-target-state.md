-->
## 🌐 Network & Infrastructure
- **Router**: Asus RT‑AX86U  
  - Provides IPv4/IPv6 connectivity  
  - Static DHCP leases for all critical nodes  
  - Delegated IPv6 prefix for predictable addressing  
  - Port forwarding only for explicitly approved services

- **LAN Subnet**: `192.168.50.0/24`  
  - Predictable addressing for all nodes  
  - Conflict detection logic in subnet router script  
  - Docker subnets auto‑excluded if overlapping

## 🖥️ Core Nodes

| Device              | Role                          | Notes                                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Synology DS218play  | NAS, Headscale host           | SSL certs via `bardi_cert.sh`              |
| QNAP TS210          | Legacy storage                |                                            |
| Ugreen DXP4800+     | Primary storage & backups     |                                            |
| Windows 11 PCs      | Clients                       | Headscale/Tailscale endpoints              |
| Android phones      | Clients                       | Headscale/Tailscale endpoints              |

## 📛 DNS & Identity
- **Authoritative DNS**  
  - Explicit A records for each LAN node  
  - CNAMEs for service aliases (no ambiguity)  
  - Internal DNS resolution via `dnsmasq`

- **Domain**: `*.bardi.ch`  
  - Internal services mapped consistently  
  - External exposure only for selected services

---

## 🔒 Certificates & Security
- **Certificate Management**  
  - `bardi_cert.sh` handles issuance/renewal  
  - DNS‑based validation (Infomaniak API)  
  - Multi‑node deployment with audit logging  
  - Timestamp + version tag echoed on each deploy

- **Secrets**  
  - No secrets in GitHub repo (only configs & docs)  
  - API tokens, pre‑auth keys, and private keys stored securely outside repo

---

## 🌍 Exposure & Access
- **Internal‑only services**: Headscale, admin dashboards  
- **Internet‑exposed services**: Only those explicitly mapped with SSL certs and port forwarding  
- **Tailscale**: Provides secure remote access without exposing management interfaces

---

## 📂 Documentation & Repo Structure

The repository is organized to keep **design docs, configs, and scripts** cleanly separated, with this handbook serving as the master reference.

## 📡 IP Address Mapping (LAN)

| Hostname             | IP Address       | Role / Notes                          |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| router.bardi.ch      | 192.168.50.1     | Asus RT‑AX86U                         |
| nas.bardi.ch         | 192.168.50.4     | Ugreen DXP4800+ (primary storage, Headscale host)                         |
| diskstation.bardi.ch | 192.168.50.2     | Synology DS218play (Headscale client)   |
| qnap.bardi.ch        | 192.168.50.3     | QNAP TS210 (legacy storage)           |

> **Note:** All static DHCP leases are configured on the Asus RT‑AX86U.  
> IPv6 addresses are delegated and predictable, but not listed here for brevity.

## 🌐 Public DNS (Informaniak)

### A Records
- `bardi.ch` → updated dynamically by teh router 192.168.50.1

### CNAME Records
- `headscale.bardi.ch` → `bardi.ch`  

> **Note:** Only expose services that are hardened and SSL‑protected.  
> Internal‑only hostnames (like `diskstation.bardi.ch`) remain LAN‑only and are not published to Informaniak.

---

## ✅ Summary
- **LAN IPs** are fixed and documented for every node.  
- **Public DNS** is minimal, with A records pointing to the router’s WAN IP and CNAMEs providing service aliases.  
- **Informaniak DNS** is the single external source of truth, while `dnsmasq` handles internal resolution.
