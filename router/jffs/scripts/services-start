# 2025-09-21 Start Dropbear on LAN and WireGuard IP
# Asuswrt-Merlin already starts Dropbear by default on port 22/2222.
# If you want to override bindings, uncomment and adjust the line below:
# dropbear -p 10.89.12.1:2222 -p 10.6.0.1:2222 -a

# --- LAN safety net ---
# Always allow SSH from the trusted LAN subnet (10.89.12.0/24) on port 2222.
# This rule guarantees that local clients on the home network can reach the router
# even if the ipset below is empty, misconfigured, or accidentally flushed.
# It acts as a permanent backdoor for administration from inside the LAN.
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s 10.89.12.0/24 --dport 2222 -j ACCEPT

# --- Controlled SSH access via VPNs (WireGuard + Tailscale) ---
# For remote access, we use an ipset to group together allowed sources:
#   - Entire WireGuard subnets (e.g. 10.6.0.0/24, 10.4.0.0/24)
#   - Specific Tailscale device IPs (100.x.y.z), see https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines
# This keeps the firewall rules simple: one iptables rule can cover many sources,
# and you can add/remove entries dynamically without editing the ruleset.

# Ensure LAN traffic (10.89.12.0/24) is always routed via the main routing table,
# not accidentally sent into the WireGuard tunnel. Without this rule, replies to
# LAN clients could be "hijacked" by WireGuard’s policy routing, breaking loc
# connectivity. This ip rule forces packets sourced from the LAN subnet to use
# the normal routing table.

# --- Tailscale ---
# Start the Tailscale daemon (tailscaled) in the background, storing its state
# under /opt/var/lib/tailscale and exposing its control socket at /opt/var/run/tailscale.
# The 'sleep 5' ensures the daemon has time to initialize before we run 'tailscale up'.
#
# 'tailscale up' then connects this router to the tailnet with the following options:
#   --accept-dns           : accept DNS settings pushed from the Tailscale admin console
#   --advertise-exit-node  : offer this router as an exit node so clients can route all
#                            their internet traffic through it
#   --advertise-routes     : announce the local LAN subnet (10.89.12.0/24) so remote
#                            Tailscale clients can reach devices on this network
#   --accept-routes        : allow this router to accept routes advertised by other
#                            Tailscale nodes (useful if you want it to reach other
#                            shared subnets in the tailnet)

# --- Reference: Managing ssh_allowed ipset and SSH firewall rule ---

# List current entries in the ipset:
#   ipset list ssh_allowed
#
# Add a new subnet or single IP:
#   ipset add ssh_allowed 10.X.Y.0/24
#   ipset add ssh_allowed 100.64.55.12
#
# Remove a subnet or single IP:
#   ipset del ssh_allowed 10.X.Y.0/24
#   ipset del ssh_allowed 100.102.21.37
#
# To immediately revoke SSH access for all subnets/IPs in ssh_allowed (empties the set but keeps it defined):
#   ipset flush ssh_allowed
#
# To restore access without rebooting, simply re-add the entries:
#   ipset add ssh_allowed 10.6.0.0/24
#   ipset add ssh_allowed 10.4.0.0/24
#   ipset add ssh_allowed 100.102.21.37
#   ...add any other trusted subnets or Tailscale IPs as needed...
#
# Destroy the ipset entirely (removes the set; any iptables rules referencing it will break):
#   ipset destroy ssh_allowed
#
# List INPUT chain rules with line numbers (to see where the SSH rule is):
#   iptables -L INPUT -n --line-numbers
#
# Delete the SSH accept rule by line number (example: line 3):
#   iptables -D INPUT 3
#
# Delete the SSH accept rule by matching it exactly:
#   iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -m set --match-set ssh_allowed src --dport 2222 -j ACCEPT
#
# Reminder: Any live changes (ipset add/del, iptables -D) are immediate but not persistent.
# Always update /jffs/scripts/services-start to reflect the desired permanent state.
